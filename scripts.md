They clearly worked together to **distract** me."

## 🎬 Scenario 2: Film Discussion (Deep Analysis)
**Duration Goal:** 4-5 minutes.
**Context:** Discussing *Interstellar* in depth.
**Key Strategy:** Don't just tell the plot. Analyze the acting, the music, and the feelings.

### 🗣️ The Discussion Script

**Step 1: Introduction (The "Hook")**
> "If I had to choose one film I **never get bored with**, it would definitely be *Interstellar*. Have you seen it? It’s a sci-fi **masterpiece** directed by Christopher Nolan. Even if you aren't into space movies, this one is different because it's emotionally **gripping**."

**Step 2: The Plot (Summary without spoilers)**
> "The story is **set in** a dystopian future where Earth is running out of food. The plot **centres on** Cooper, an ex-pilot who has to leave his children behind to lead a mission through a wormhole to find a new home for humanity. It’s a race against time."

**Step 3: The "Review" (Unit 10 Adjectives)**
> "What makes it **outstanding** is the visual accuracy. The way they depict the black hole is **stunning**. But more than that, it’s deeply **poignant**. The relationship between the father and his daughter is the heart of the film. There’s a scene where he watches video messages from his kids after years in space... honestly, it’s **heart-breaking**. It really **makes you think** about the relativity of time."

**Step 4: The Cast & Music**
> "It **stars** Matthew McConaughey, who gives a really **convincing** performance. Also, the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is incredible—it’s extremely **intense** and builds a lot of **suspense**."

**Step 5: Partner Questions (To extend the chat)**
* *Partner:* "I heard it's very long. Did you find it slow?"
* *You:* "That's a valid point. It is nearly 3 hours long. However, I didn't find it slow because the pacing is excellent. There are some quiet moments, but then it becomes incredibly **fast-paced** during the action scenes."
* *Partner:* "Is it violent?"
* *You:* "No, not really. It’s not **gory** at all. It’s more psychologically **intense** than violent."

## 🏞️ Scenario 3: The City Tour (The "Day & Night" Experience)
**Duration Goal:** 5 minutes.
**Context:** A full day itinerary in Cochabamba (Nature + Gastronomy + Nightlife).
**Key Strategy:** Use "Two-Part Phrases" and "Estimates" to sound natural.

### 🚌 Part 1: The Day Trip (Corani)
> "Okay, since we have the whole day, **let's head over to** the Corani Lake first. It’s **roughly** a 90-minute drive from the city.
>
> It’s a massive reservoir **surrounded by** pine forests. The **breadth** of the lake is impressive. It’s the perfect place to get some **peace and quiet** away from the city noise. We can walk across the bridges—it’s very atmospheric because **every now and then**, the fog rolls in and it looks quite mysterious. It is **well worth a visit** for the photos alone."

### 🍽️ Part 2: The Food (Gastronomic Capital)
> "By the time we get back, we’ll be starving. We can't visit Cochabamba without eating properly. The **story goes that** people here live to eat, not eat to live!
>
> I recommend we try 'Pique Macho'. Be warned, the portions are massive—**somewhere in the region of** a kilogram of meat and potatoes per plate! It’s a bit spicy, but delicious. It’s a real **must-try** experience."

### 🌃 Part 3: The Nightlife (El Boulevard/Recoleta)
> "To finish the day, we should go to 'El Boulevard'. It has its **ups and downs** depending on the night, but generally, it’s very vibrant.
>
> We can start at a quiet lounge to talk, and then, if you have the energy, we can go to a club. The nightlife here is quite **mainstream**, mostly reggaeton and pop, but the energy is great. It’s the perfect way to see the city come alive."

### 🗣️ Interaction Phrases (To keep the partner engaged)
* "Does that sound like a plan to you?"
* "Are you a fan of spicy food, or should we pick something milder?"
* "Have you ever seen a landscape like that before?"
* "To be honest, it depends on what you prefer—nature or party?"
