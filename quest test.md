## 🚨 Unit 9: Witness & Crime (Page 104-113)

### 1. Discussing Crime Rates (Page 104, Ex 1 & 2)
**Task:** Discuss common crimes in your city and decide which are serious vs. minor.

> **Model Response:**
> "To be honest, **petty crimes** like **graffiti** and **shoplifting** are fairly common in my neighbourhood. However, I think we need to distinguish between minor offences and serious felonies. While **vandalism** is annoying/unsightly, it doesn't compare to the severity of **mugging** or **identity theft**, which can financially **devastate** a person. Personally, I find **bribery** particularly worrying because it undermines trust in society."

### 2. Moral Dilemmas: "What would you have done?" (Page 106, Ex 6A)
**Task:** React to hypothetical situations (pickpocketing, shoplifting, vandalism).
**Grammar Focus:** *Third Conditional / Past Modals* (I would have...).

> **Scenario A: Catching a pickpocket**
> "If I had caught a pickpocket trying to take my mobile, I **would have shouted** to alert others. However, I **wouldn't have tried** to physically stop them because it’s too risky; they **might have had** a weapon."
>
> **Scenario B: Friend shoplifting**
> "This is a tricky situation. If I had seen a friend shoplifting, I **wouldn't have reported** them to the police immediately. Instead, I **would have confronted** them privately. I **would have tried to persuade** them to put the item back. Reporting a friend feels like a betrayal unless it's a major crime."

### 3. Discussing Scams (Page 107-108, Ex 3 & 6)
**Task:** Discuss why people fall for scams or describe a scam you know.
**Vocab Focus:** *Deceive, distract, snatch, fall for*.

> **Model Response:**
> "I think people **fall for** scams because con artists are experts at **diverting attention**. For example, in the 'Tourist Photo' scam, they act friendly to **distract** you, and while you are posing, an accomplice **snatches** your bag. It **never occurs to** the victim that the 'kind stranger' is actually a thief **posing as** a tourist. I consider myself cautious, but I **might get taken in by** a tech support scam if it sounded professional enough."

### 4. Role-Play: Reporting an Incident (Page 110-111, Ex 5 & 6) ⭐ *High Probability*
**Task:** Student A reports a theft/accident; Student B is the Police Officer asking for details.

> **Role A: The Victim (Caller)**
> "Officer, I need to report a theft. It happened **just moments ago** on Park Avenue. I was in a changing room and **before I realised what was happening**, my bag was gone. It **never crossed my mind** that someone could reach under the curtain. My mind just **went blank** for a second. The suspect was wearing a hoodie and looked **roughly** twenty years old."
>
> **Role B: The Police Officer**
> "I understand, please try to stay calm. Could you **pinpoint the exact time** of the incident? Can you give me a detailed description of the offender? Did you notice anyone acting suspiciously in the **vicinity** before the theft occurred?"

### 5. Survival Priorities (Page 113, Ex 3)
**Task:** Choose 6 items to take on a life raft (agreement/disagreement).
**Vocab Focus:** *Vital, crucial, priority, essential*.

> **Model Response:**
> "I feel strongly that the water collector is a **top priority** because dehydration is the most immediate threat. While the fishing kit is useful, I don't think it's as **vital** as the first aid kit. I **propose we choose** the mirror for signalling rescue, as that is **crucial** for our survival. Do you agree, or do you have a different **priority**?"

## 🎭 Unit 10: Culture & Arts (Page 116-125)

### 1. Describing a Film (Page 116, Ex 1, 2, 4) ⭐ *Classic Task*
**Task:** Describe a film you never get bored with (without saying the name, or just reviewing it).
**Vocab Focus:** *Gripping, stunning, thought-provoking, cast, plot*.

> **Model Response:**
> "One film I **never get bored with** is *Inception*. It's a **gripping** sci-fi thriller **set in** a world of dreams. The plot **centres on** a thief who steals corporate secrets. What I love most is the **outstanding** visual effects and the **thought-provoking** ending—it really keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting is **superb**, especially the lead actor. It’s definitely a **must-see**."

### 2. Discussing Art & Performances (Page 119-121, Ex 5)
**Task:** Talk about the best concert, exhibition, or photo you've seen.
**Vocab Focus:** *Rave reviews, letdown, hype, ground-breaking*.

> **Model Response:**
> "The most **memorable** gig I've ever been to was by [Artist Name]. The atmosphere was electric. Even though the venue was crowded, the performance was **stunning**. To be honest, I had read some **rave reviews**, so my expectations were high, but it certainly wasn't a **letdown**. It was actually quite **ground-breaking** compared to their studio albums."

### 3. Using Two-Part Phrases (Page 121, Ex 8)
**Task:** Discuss habits using idioms like *ups and downs, peace and quiet*.

> **Model Response:**
> "I love living in the city, but **every now and then** I need some **peace and quiet**, so I escape to the countryside. Like everything, city life has its **pros and cons**. Sometimes I get **sick and tired of** the noise/traffic, but on the other hand, the culture here improves by **leaps and bounds** every year."

### 4. Role-Play: Giving a Tour (Page 123, Ex 7) ⭐ *High Probability*
**Task:** Student A leads a tour of a city; Student B asks questions about age, size, history.
**Vocab Focus:** *Head over to, worth a visit, story goes, estimates*.

> **Role A: The Guide**
> "Okay, **let's head over to** the main square. On your left, you'll see the Old Cathedral, which was **founded in** the 16th century. It's **well worth a visit** for the architecture alone. The **story goes that** hidden tunnels lie beneath it. If you look at the tower, it's **somewhere in the region of** 80 metres high."
>
> **Role B: The Tourist**
> "That's fascinating. What is the exact **height** of that monument? Was it **named after** a famous general? And honestly, is the museum **worth the time**, or is it just a tourist trap?"

### 5. Town Project Decision (Page 125, Ex 4 & 5)
**Task:** Decide on a project for your town (botanical garden, cinema, sculpture, etc.).
**Vocab Focus:** *Beneficial, in favour of, concerns*.

> **Model Response:**
> "I'm really **in favour of** the botanical garden project. I think it would be **beneficial for the community** as it appeals to all ages and provides a green space. While a multiplex cinema is entertaining, I’d rather have something that **makes a statement** about sustainability. **The only thing that concerns me** is the maintenance cost, but surely the long-term benefits outweigh that."

## 🛠️ General Interaction Strategy (Fillers & Connectors)

*Use these if you need time to think or want to sound natural:*

* **Buying time:** "That's an interesting question... let me think." / "My mind just went blank for a second."
* **Clarifying:** "To be more precise..." / "What I meant to say was..."
* **Checking agreement:** "Don't you agree?" / "What's your take on that?"
* **Adding surprising facts:** "Believe it or not..." / "Interestingly enough..." / "Apparently..."
