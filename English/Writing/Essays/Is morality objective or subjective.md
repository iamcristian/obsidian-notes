# Is Morality Objective or Subjective?

> **Essay Type:** Discursive

---
## The Issue
> Are moral statements ("murder is wrong") objective facts independent of human opinion, or are they subjective expressions of individual or cultural preferences?

## Balanced Position
> The debate reveals genuine difficulties on both sides; a sophisticated understanding likely incorporates elements of both objectivism and subjectivism.

## Introduction

Few questions in philosophy have generated more disagreement than the nature of morality. When we say "torture is wrong," are we stating a fact about the universe—as objective as "water is H₂O"—or merely expressing a preference, like saying "chocolate is delicious"? This question is not merely academic. If morality is subjective, can we genuinely condemn atrocities in other cultures? If it is objective, where do moral facts come from, and how do we access them? **This essay will examine the strongest arguments on both sides before reaching a nuanced conclusion that acknowledges the complexity of this enduring debate.**

## Arguments FOR Moral Objectivism

### Argument 1: Moral Disagreement Presupposes Objective Truth

When people debate moral issues—abortion, capital punishment, wealth inequality—they behave as though there is a correct answer to discover. We argue, present evidence, and try to persuade because we believe the other side is *wrong*, not merely different. If morality were purely subjective, moral disagreement would be as pointless as arguing whether chocolate or vanilla tastes better. The very practice of moral discourse suggests that participants believe in objective moral truths, even if they disagree about what those truths are. This is the view held by moral realists, from Plato to contemporary philosophers like Derek Parfit.

### Argument 2: Some Moral Claims Seem Obviously True

Consider the statement: "Torturing innocent children for fun is wrong." This seems not merely culturally preferred but *true*—true in all times, all places, regardless of what anyone believes. Moral objectivists argue that such intuitions provide evidence for objective moral facts. If subjectivism implies that torturing children could be acceptable (if a culture or individual approved), then subjectivism must be false. Our strongest moral convictions resist reduction to mere preferences.

**Transition:** These arguments are formidable, yet the case for moral subjectivism raises equally serious challenges.

## Arguments AGAINST Moral Objectivism (For Subjectivism)

### Argument 1: The Problem of Moral Disagreement

If objective moral truths exist, why is there so much disagreement about them? In science, disagreements tend to resolve over time as evidence accumulates. But moral disagreements—about abortion, animal rights, the limits of free speech—show no signs of converging. Different cultures have held radically different views on slavery, gender roles, and violence. The most parsimonious explanation, subjectivists argue, is that there are no objective moral facts to discover; morality is a human construction that varies across time and place. This is the view defended by philosophers like J.L. Mackie, who called objective moral values "queer entities" that have no place in a naturalistic worldview.

### Argument 2: The Evolutionary Debunking Argument

Our moral intuitions are products of evolution. We feel that cooperation is good and betrayal is bad because these responses helped our ancestors survive and reproduce. But evolution selects for survival, not truth. Our moral sense, like our fear of snakes or attraction to sugar, may be useful without tracking any objective reality. If we would have the same moral intuitions whether or not objective moral truths existed, then these intuitions provide no evidence for such truths. This argument suggests that our confident moral beliefs may be illusions shaped by natural selection.

## Synthesis: Weighing the Arguments

| Objectivism | Subjectivism |
|-------------|--------------|
| Explains moral discourse and disagreement | Explains moral diversity across cultures |
| Captures strong moral intuitions | Avoids metaphysical "queerness" |
| Faces the question: Where do moral facts come from? | Faces the question: Can we condemn atrocities? |

Both sides face significant challenges. Objectivism must explain how we access non-natural moral facts and why disagreement persists. Subjectivism must explain why moral discourse seems truth-apt and how we can criticize other cultures without appealing to objective standards.

## Conclusion

The debate between moral objectivism and subjectivism remains unresolved after millennia of philosophical inquiry. Objectivism captures our sense that some moral truths—like the wrongness of gratuitous cruelty—hold universally, yet struggles to explain the metaphysical status of moral facts. Subjectivism accommodates moral diversity and avoids metaphysical mystery, yet seems unable to condemn genuine atrocities as *wrong* rather than merely *different*. **Perhaps the wisest stance is humility: holding our deepest moral convictions firmly enough to act on them, while remaining open to the possibility that our understanding is incomplete. In ethics, as in life, certainty may be less valuable than thoughtful engagement with irreducible complexity.**
