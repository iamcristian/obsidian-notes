# The unmoved mover argument supports the existence of God

The 'unmoved mover' argument is a primary argument in the defense of God's existence.

All observed changes in the universe happen only because an external force caused them to: that truth is the base assumption here, the foundation of the argument.

Now imagine a toddler asks you a question: "How do birds fly?" Easy enough to answer. But toddlers are persistent -you answer "because they have wings." but they persist and ask why again. Let's take it to the extreme. The toddler asks why (or how) again and again, almost endlessly, until you are at the scale of creation: "how was the universe created?"

You had an explanation for each and every question. Until now. Every mover, had a mover. Every cause, an effect. Every result, a reason.

If you follow this line of reasoning to the very beginning- the creation of the universe -there is no answer. The big bang happened... because it happened? No. Who was the mover? The mover can only be an entity who themselves, are unmoved. A trait that no other entity can emulate, but God.
